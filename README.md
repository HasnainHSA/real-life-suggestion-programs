Real-Life Suggestion Programs in Python

Overview

This project consists of five Python programs designed to provide real-life suggestions based on user inputs. These programs utilize variables, while loops, and conditional statements to interact with the user and generate recommendations. Each program is independent and follows simple coding principles, making them easy to understand and execute.
